âœ… What are First-Class Functions in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens (or first-class objects). This means functions are treated like any other 
variable â€” you can:

â€¢ Store them in variables
â€¢ Pass them as arguments to other functions
â€¢ Return them from other functions
â€¢ Store them in objects and arrays

ðŸ“Œ Definition:
First-class functions means that functions can be assigned to variables, passed around as values, and returned from other
functions â€” just like any other data type (e.g., numbers, strings, etc.).

function abcd(val){              //Function abcd takes another function as an argument
    val();
}

abcd(function(){                 //Calling abcd function and passing another function as an argument
    console.log(`Hello World`);
})   


/*
abcd(function(){})
It reprsents 
    val = function(){
       return `Hello World!`;
    }
