/* 
If else -> The if...else statement is a conditional statement that executes a block of code if a 
specified condition is true. If the condition is false, it can execute an optional else block. You can 
also use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

    console.log("a is greater than b");
} else if (a === b) {
    console.log("a is Strictly equal to b");

// Switch case -> The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

/* ðŸš¨Queestion -> What is the difference between switch case and if else?
Answer -> The main difference between switch case and if else is that switch case is used to check for equality, while if else can 
be used to check for a variety of conditions. Switch case is also more efficient than if else when there are multiple conditions to 
check, as it only evaluates the expression once, while if else evaluates the condition multiple times.
